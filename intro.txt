Hello, how it is going?
Where are u living?
Harvard Medical School

Research work in collaboration with PhD Shrike Zhang in lab Zhang lab- Harvard Medical School
Working on designing computer vision algorithms for differences detection Medical Cultures
Working to manipulate an robotic arm for medical porposes 

Intel
Most of my team were based at Oregon, My manager was Ryan Saffores
- Crystal Ridge: Validate the perfomance of server architecture in differents operative systems, ubuntu, centos, rhal
Add a level memory
2LM: Volatile Memory, with this dimm your past RAM it behaves as cache memory
AppDIrect: Non Volatile Memory: Some configuration 8+8
Python scripting to automate configuration and data parsing (Bandwith, latency) avoid bottleneck

- QAT: QuickAssistant Technology of intel, driver that improve algorithms, I have been working with compression
and encryption algorithms. Virtualization of the driver in VM's (attach/detach) devices. And Virtualize in docker
containers and kubernetes

Hp Labs:

Implement 3D printing/slicers containers into Docker containers
Predict the output of some materials with machine learning, using tensorflow and racket most of them
Automatize containers virtualization with jenkins

Conacyt Undergraduate Researcher
Implement digital laboratories for a digital university in mexico, with python and a nodeRed GUI
Implemented host services like apache and ngrok

Fluxing Engineering
Implemented a SLAM algorithm using a Rplidar A1 in ROS
Simulated an obstacle avoidance algorithm in MATLAB
Used language C, ISR in a NXP S32K144EVB, used of UART, I2C, ADC communications protocols.

SelfCar
Humanoid Nao robots
Sumo robot
