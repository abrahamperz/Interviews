Computer architecture
- Central Processing Unit can have multiple cores
  - Each core has a control unit, arithmetic and logic unit and various registers
	- Control Unit: Input/Ouputs regulates and integrates operations 
	- ALU: Mathematical and logical operations
	- Registers: Small fast storage/accesible location. Some have specific functions, read-only or write-only. (ASM)
  - Memory and graphics controllers are built into CPU:
	- Memory controllers: Circuit that manages the flow of data going to and from the computers main memory
	- Graphics controllers: Proccesses the graphics received by computer and creates dots and lines on the screen to generate a picture

- Base clock frecuency os provided by a crystal oscillator
- CPU can adjust its clocks speed dynamically

Performance
- Large codebases.
- Non-code assets, like binaries or graphics.
- Code dependencies, particularly across components.
